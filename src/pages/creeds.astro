      <div class="creed-text">
        <p>We believe in one God,<br>
        the Father almighty,<br>
        maker of heaven and earth,<br>
        of all things visible and invisible.</p>
        <p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ,<br>

        begotten from the Father before all ages,<br>
        God from God,<br>
        Light from Light,<br>
        true God from true God,<br>
        begotten, not made;<br>
        of the same essence as the Father.<br>
        Through him all things were made.<br>
        For us and for our salvation<br>
        he came down from heaven;<br>
        he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary,<br>
        and was made human.<br>
        He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;<br>
        he suffered and was buried.<br>
        The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.<br>
        He ascended to heaven<br>
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
        He will come again with glory<br>
        to judge the living and the dead.<br>
        His kingdom will never end.</p>
        <p>And we believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
        the Lord, the giver of life.<br>
        He proceeds from the Father and the Son,<br>
        and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified.<br>
        He spoke through the prophets.<br>
        We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.<br>
        We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
        We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,<br>
        and to life in the world to come. Amen.</p>
